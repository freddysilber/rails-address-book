## Idea

	As a user, I needed a way to manage personal/ business accounts (clients or jobs) as well as any connections
	accossiated with the given accounts. Since accounts can have many peopel who might work for the given buisness,
	I also wanted to create a way to relate contacts to these professional connections. Not only can this application 
	help manage personal or work related connections, but it can also keep track of your account's projects and tasks.
	Using this app, I aimed for a clean way to keep my work for our clients in one easy place as a reference.
